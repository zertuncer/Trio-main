/// Decoded clinical-stream record (0x08981ab8). Distinct from
/// `HistoricalReadingPage`: clinical pages are NOT six samples at
/// 5-minute stride — each page is a single time-point record with seven
/// 16-bit fields, emitted once per minute while the sensor is connected.
///
/// The clinical stream mirrors two values from the realtime stream at the
/// same sensor life count: word[5] is the current-minute glucose, and word[6]
/// is the most recent 5-minute committed historical glucose. That fixes the
/// currently modeled field mapping:
///
/// | word | bytes | meaning                                              |
/// | ---- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
/// |  0   | 0–1   | `lifeCount` — current minute (page emitted per minute)|
/// |  1   | 2–3   | raw sensor channel (rises with glucose)              |
/// |  2   | 4–5   | raw sensor channel                                   |
/// |  3   | 6–7   | raw sensor channel (high byte pinned 0x0e; temp?)    |
/// |  4   | 8–9   | reserved / zero (only 0x0000 observed)               |
/// |  5   | 10–11 | current-minute glucose — equals realtime current     |
/// |  6   | 12–13 | most recent 5-min committed glucose — equals realtime|
/// |      |       | embedded historical                                  |
///
/// `currentGlucoseRaw` (word[5]) is the same per-minute value the
/// realtime stream emits, keyed at this record's own `lifeCount` (no
/// offset). `historicGlucoseRaw` (word[6]) is the same 5-minute committed
/// value the realtime stream carries as its embedded historical; its
/// lifeCount is the most recent 5-minute boundary, which this record does
/// not itself carry (the realtime frame's `historicalLifeCount` does).
///
/// **5-min-boundary finalization for word[6]:** the historic value steps
/// forward at `lifeCount ≡ 2 (mod 5)` and lands on the boundary
/// `lifeCount - 17` (snapped down to a multiple of 5). The 17-minute lag is
/// modeled as a protocol parameter paired with the 5-minute historical
/// interval. Even so, authoritative pairing of `historicGlucoseRaw` to a
/// lifeCount should prefer the realtime frame's own `historicalLifeCount`
/// field when available; the helper below is provided for cases where only
/// the clinical record is in hand.
///
/// **Gap-fill behavior:** the clinical
/// CCCD buffers records sensor-side while the host is disconnected and
/// replays the buffered window in a burst on resubscribe. This makes the
/// clinical stream the currently modeled way to recover minute-resolution
/// glucose for a disconnect window. Historical paged backfill commits only at
/// 5-minute boundaries and lags current by about 17 minutes. Apps that care
/// about gap-fill should subscribe to the clinical CCCD and forward
/// `currentGlucose` keyed at `lifeCount`, deduping against samples already
/// received via the realtime stream.
///
/// Apps integrating this should consume `currentGlucose` keyed by
/// `lifeCount` (offset 0). `historicGlucoseRaw` is redundant with the
/// realtime embedded historical and should not be keyed at this
/// record's `lifeCount` — use `historicLifeCountEstimate` (or the
/// realtime frame's `historicalLifeCount`) instead.
