/// LibreLoop's LocalizedString).

/// Resolves `Bundle.module` where the LoopKit-family helpers use
/// `Bundle(for: SomeType.self)`. LibreCRKit is a SwiftPM package, so its
/// resources live in a generated resource bundle beside the code; `Bundle(for:)`
/// would find the code bundle, report no localizations, and make every lookup
/// fall through to the key.
///
/// Only text an end user actually reads belongs here. Diagnostic output stays
/// English on purpose — `CustomStringConvertible` descriptions, pairing
/// transcripts, and hex dumps end up in logs and bug reports, where a
/// locale-dependent value cannot be compared across users.
