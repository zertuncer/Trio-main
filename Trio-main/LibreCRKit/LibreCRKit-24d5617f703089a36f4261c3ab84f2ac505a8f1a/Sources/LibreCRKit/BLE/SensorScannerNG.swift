// SensorScannerNG -- event-driven CBCentralManager wrapper.
//
// Every CB delegate callback yields a single typed event on the
// events() stream. There are no pending-operation dictionaries, no
// continuation pools, no DispatchWorkItems for timeouts. Callers
// drive their own state machines off the events.
//
// This is the planned replacement for SensorScanner. Once consumers
// are migrated over, the old class will be removed.
